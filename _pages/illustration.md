A Spanning Tree (ST) is a spanning subgraph without any cycle. 
Its edges are *repelling* each other.

On the LHS, sampling of a ST with Wilson's algorithm (wait a few seconds to see the output of the loop erased random walk). On the RHS, the output.
More about that in [Sparsification of the regularized magnetic Laplacian
with multi-type spanning forests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14797); see also the [Julia code.](https://github.com/For-a-few-DPPs-more/MagneticLaplacianSparsifier.jl)
