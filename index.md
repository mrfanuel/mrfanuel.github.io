Currently I am researcher at [Imec](https://www.imec-int.com/en).

Until June 2025, I was a CNRS postdoc at [CRIStAL](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/) in the [SigMA](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/?rubrique27&eid=30) team in Lille. My advisor was [Rémi Bardenet](https://rbardenet.github.io/).

Before that, I did several years of postdoc at KU Leuven (Stadius Center for Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing and Data Analytics)  with [Johan Suykens](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/sista/members/suykens.html) and a one-year postdoc at UCLouvain with [Jean-Charles Delvenne](https://perso.uclouvain.be/jean-charles.delvenne/welcome.html) in the Mathematical Engineering department.

I defended my PhD in theoretical physics under the supervision of [Jan Govaerts](https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/public/member/17) in the Research Institute in Mathematics and Physics of UCLouvain. My master degree in Physics was obtained in the same institute.
